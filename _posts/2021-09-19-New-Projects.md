<h1 id="question_1">Scope and Introduction</h1>
<p>
**Scope** This research guide is designed to assist students and scholars in researching Canadian law. The guide details resources for conducting research on the Canadian Constitution, federal and provincial statutes, court cases, and regulations. It also provides information on relevant secondary sources and helpful websites.
 
The call numbers listed in this guide link to Ross-Blakley Law Library catalog records, which provide information about location and availability of items in the Library collection. Many of the Library’s print international resources can be found in the Foreign & International Collection in the basement of the Library: they appear in the online catalog with the location code “Law Foreign & International.” Electronic resources are indicated in the online catalog with the location code “Online access.” Some electronic resources listed in this guide are only accessible to Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law students, faculty, and staff.
 
**Introduction to the Canadian Legal System**
Canada is a democratic constitutional monarchy, with the British Sovereign as the head of State and an elected Prime Minister as the head of Government. The country has a federal system of parliamentary government, in which government responsibilities are shared between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments. There are three branches of government: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The Executive branch of government is made up of the British Sovereign, the Cabinet (which includes the Prime Minister), and the administration. The Legislative branch consists of Parliament, and the Judicial branch is composed of the courts of the National Federal Court system as well as the provincial and territorial courts. The federal courts and the court system in nine of the ten provinces and the three territories are based on English common law; in Québec the court system is based on French civil law.

<h2 id="question_2">Concept</h2>
<p>This project built on the information in a <strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/making-interactive-maps-in-r-with-less-than-15-lines-of-code-bfd81f587e12">Towards Data Science</a></strong>&nbsp;Medium post by Brandon Walker.</p>
<h2 id="question_3">Data</h2>
<p>These maps were built using data from the <strong><a href="https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/libraries/resource/b7158429-b69e-4f87-8a96-b4857c6d65b5">Phoenix, AZ Open Data Portal</a></strong>. The data was not linked through the API (since it was broken at the time of creation) so the data is static as of 10/1/2020.</p>
