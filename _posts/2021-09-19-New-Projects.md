<h1 id="question_1">Scope and Introduction</h1>
<p>
This research guide is designed to assist students and scholars in researching Canadian law. The guide details resources for conducting research on the Canadian Constitution, federal and provincial statutes, court cases, and regulations. It also provides information on relevant secondary sources and helpful websites.
 
The call numbers listed in this guide link to Ross-Blakley Law Library catalog records, which provide information about location and availability of items in the Library collection. Many of the Library’s print international resources can be found in the Foreign & International Collection in the basement of the Library: they appear in the online catalog with the location code “Law Foreign & International.” Electronic resources are indicated in the online catalog with the location code “Online access.” Some electronic resources listed in this guide are only accessible to Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law students, faculty, and staff.
 
**Introduction to the Canadian Legal System**
Canada is a democratic constitutional monarchy, with the British Sovereign as the head of State and an elected Prime Minister as the head of Government. The country has a federal system of parliamentary government, in which government responsibilities are shared between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments. There are three branches of government: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The Executive branch of government is made up of the British Sovereign, the Cabinet (which includes the Prime Minister), and the administration. The Legislative branch consists of Parliament, and the Judicial branch is composed of the courts of the National Federal Court system as well as the provincial and territorial courts. The federal courts and the court system in nine of the ten provinces and the three territories are based on English common law; in Québec the court system is based on French civil law.

<h2 id="question_2">Journals and Other Secondary Sources</h2>
<p>Journals
Below is a short list of sources for locating journals published in Canada or articles published about Canadian law. 
International & Non-U.S. Law Journals (HeinOnline) This HeinOnline library contains journals focused on international law topics as well as journals published outside of the United States.
 
Canada Journals (Westlaw - password required) This Westlaw database contains the full text of nearly 40 Canadian legal journals and periodicals, as well as a number of newsletters and law reports. Coverage varies by source. </p>

<p>Other Secondary Sources**
The Practical Guide to Canadian Legal Research (2010) The Practical Guide to Canadian Legal Research provides an excellent overview of print and electronic resources for locating Canadian law. The book covers legal encyclopedias and dictionaries, periodicals, case law, statutes, regulations, Quebec law (based on French civil law), and more. 
Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (Westlaw – password required) The Canadian Encyclopedic Digest is the only Canadian legal encyclopedia. </p>

<p>The Best Guide to Canadian Legal Research
This guide to Canadian legal research is written by Catherine Best, a research lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia. The guide provides a step-by-step plan for conducting legal research and recommends both print and online sources for conducting research on Canadian law. Please note that the author often references QuickLaw (a LexisNexis product) and LawSource (a Westlaw Canada product) for Canadian law – many of the primary materials contained in these databases can be accessed in the Westlaw law school database (password required).</p>
 
<p>Canada Treatises (Westlaw – password required) This Westlaw database contains Canadian treatises covering all aspects of Canadian law.
Researching Canadian Law (2019) is an online overview of the Canadian legal system written by Kim Nayyer on GlobaLex (an electronic legal publication dedicated to international and foreign law research). This guide is a compact, efficient starting point for Canadian legal research which is accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the subject matter.  It covers everything from statutes and caselaw to Canadian law school admissions and Canadian law firms.</p>
 
<p>Created by NYU law librarians, this online guide has now been updated 3 times over the years (which speaks well, in my opinion, for continued updates).  
Canadian Abridgment Digests on WestlawNext Canada (password required) is an online digest, in outline form, with headnotes so that the user can easily locate caselaw related to specific topics.  It covers “virtually every case reported in Canada since 1803, and every reported or unreported case received from the courts since 1986, with the exception of Quebec civil law cases.”</p>


<h2 id="question_3">Constitution</h2>
<p>The Canadian constitution is not one single document, but rather is comprised of multiple pieces of British and Canadian legislation.

This Canadian Department of Justice website provides access to the Constitution Acts and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
